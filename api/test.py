Add only OmniSwitches that have v ideo cameras connected.  \n• Mark all ports that are connected to other OmniSwitches and all other inter -switch connections as Uplink p orts.  \n \nKnown Issues and Limitations  \n \nCRVMS- 39 - Some vendor's cameras are not natively supported in the Milestone xProtect VMS and are installed \nusing a universal d river. Using the universal driver could result in an incorrect MAC address being associated with \nthe camera in the Milestone xProtect VMS. This results in the OmniSwitch Milestone Plugin (ALOM) using the \nincorrect MAC address and being unable to correctly identify the camera.  \n \nResolution:  \n1. Ensure all cameras are added using the vendor specific driver or ONVIF protocol in the Milestone xProtect VMS.  \n2. Once the vendor specific drivers are installed, verify the MAC addresses of any affected cameras.  \n3. Use the ALOM Plugin to scan the OmniSwitch where the cameras are connected to associate the Camera Name and IP Address to the Ports table.  \n \n  4.
