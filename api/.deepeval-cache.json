They have similar objectives, such as supporting the detection of defects in work products (see section 1.1.1), but there are also some differences, such as:  \\n  - Static and dynamic testing (with analysis of failures) can both lead to the detection of defects; however, there are some defect types that can only be found by either static or dynamic testing.  \\n  - Static testing finds defects directly, while dynamic testing causes failures from which the associated defects are determined through subsequent analysis.  \\n  - Static testing may more easily detect defects that lay on paths through the code that are rarely executed or hard to reach using dynamic testing.  \\n  - Static testing can be applied to non-executable work products, while dynamic testing can only be applied to executable work products.  \\n  - Static testing can be used to measure quality characteristics that are not dependent on executing code (e.g., maintainability), while dynamic testing can be used to measure quality characteristics that are dependent on executing code (e.g., performance efficiency).  \\n  \\n  Typical defects that are easier and/or cheaper to find through static testing include:  \\n  - Defects in requirements (e.g., inconsistencies, ambiguities, contradictions, omissions, inaccuracies, duplications)\", \"- **FL-3.2.4** (K2) Compare and contrast the different review types  \\n  - **FL-3.2.5** (K1) Recall the factors that contribute to a successful review  \\n  \\n  **3.1. Static Testing Basics**  \\n  In contrast to dynamic testing, in static testing the software under test does not need to be executed. Code, process specification, system architecture specification, or other work products are evaluated through manual examination (e.g., reviews) or with the help of a tool (e.g., static analysis). Test objectives include improving quality, detecting defects, and assessing characteristics like readability, completeness, correctness, testability, and consistency. Static testing can be applied for both verification and validation. Testers, business representatives, and developers work together during example mappings, collaborative user story writing, and backlog refinement sessions to ensure that user stories and related work products meet defined criteria, e.g., the Definition of Ready (see section 5.1.3). Review techniques can be applied to ensure user stories are complete and understandable and include testable acceptance criteria. By asking the right questions, testers explore, challenge, and help improve the proposed user stories.\", \"testing does not. Static testing includes reviews (see chapter 3) and static analysis. Dynamic testing uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases (see chapter 4). Testing is not only a technical activity. It also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated, monitored and controlled (see chapter 5). Testers use tools (see chapter 6), but it is important to remember that testing is largely an intellectual activity, requiring the testers to have specialized knowledge, use analytical skills and apply critical thinking and systems thinking (Myers 2011, Roman 2018).

Testing and Debugging**\\n  \\n  Testing and debugging are separate activities. Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects in the software (dynamic testing) or can directly find defects in the test object (static testing). When dynamic testing (see chapter 4) triggers a failure, debugging is concerned with finding causes of this failure (defects), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them. The typical debugging process in this case involves:  \\n  - Reproduction of a failure  \\n  - Diagnosis (finding the root cause)  \\n  - Fixing the cause  \\n  \\n  Subsequent confirmation testing checks whether the fixes resolved the problem. Preferably, confirmation testing is done by the same person who performed the initial test. Subsequent regression testing can also be performed, to check whether the fixes are causing failures in other parts of the test object (see section 2.2.3 for more information on confirmation testing and regression testing). When static testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since static testing directly finds defects, and cannot cause failures (see chapter 3).\\n  \\n  **1.2.

Testing Principles**\\n  \\n  Principles are fundamental truths that provide a basis for testing activities. They support the test process and its success, ensuring the test process is efficient and effective. The seven principles of testing are:  \\n  \\n  1. **Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence**: Testing can show that defects are present in a test object, but it cannot prove that there are no defects. It can only prove that some specific defects are not present. It is not possible to test for all possible inputs and conditions, so testing can only provide a degree of confidence that the test object will behave as expected.  \\n  \\n  2. **Exhaustive testing is not possible**: It is not possible to test all possible inputs, conditions, and states in a complex system. Therefore, it is important to select a representative subset of test cases based on risk, coverage, or other criteria. This means that testing should be planned and focused on areas of highest risk and impact.  \\n  \\n  3. **Early testing saves time and money**: The cost of fixing defects increases as they move further down the SDLC. By finding and fixing defects early, testing can help reduce overall project costs. This is why testing should start as early as possible in the development lifecycle.\", \"**1.4.5. Test Roles**\\n  \\n  Different roles in testing include:  \\n  - Test Manager: Oversees the overall test process, planning, and resource management.  \\n  - Test Analyst: Defines and designs test cases, based on requirements and risk analysis.  \\n  - Test Designer: Creates test scripts and test data.  \\n  - Test Executor: Runs the tests and records results.  \\n  - Test Lead: Coordinates the test team and manages test execution.  \\n  - Test Consultant: Provides expert advice and guidance on testing practices and processes.\\n  \\n  **1.5. Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing**\\n  \\n  **1.5.1. Generic Skills**\\n  \\n  Testers need a range of skills, including:  \\n  - Analytical skills to understand and evaluate requirements and test conditions.  \\n  - Critical thinking to identify potential defects and assess testing effectiveness.  \\n  - Communication skills to effectively report and discuss test results and issues.  \\n  - Technical skills to understand and work with the test object and related tools.\\n  \\n  **1.5.2. Whole Team Approach**\\n  \\n  A whole team approach to testing involves integrating testing activities throughout the development process, with all team members contributing to and supporting testing efforts. This approach helps to improve quality and efficiency by ensuring that testing is not treated as a separate phase but as an integral part of the development lifecycle.\\n  \\n  **1.5.3. Independence of Testing**\", \"- Level of detail of test documentation  \\n  - Choice of test techniques and test approach  \\n  - Extent of test automation  \\n  - Role and responsibilities of a tester  \\n  \\n  In sequential development models, in the initial phases testers typically participate in requirement reviews, test analysis, and test design. The executable code is usually created in the later phases, so typically dynamic testing cannot be performed early in the SDLC.  \\n  \\n  In some iterative and incremental development models, it is assumed that each iteration delivers a working prototype or product increment. This implies that in each iteration both static and dynamic testing may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive regression testing.  \\n  \\n  Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project. Therefore, lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make regression testing easier are favored in agile projects.

Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing**\\n  \\n  **1.5.1. Generic Skills**\\n  \\n  Testers need a range of skills, including:  \\n  - Analytical skills to understand and evaluate requirements and test conditions.  \\n  - Critical thinking to identify potential defects and assess testing effectiveness.  \\n  - Communication skills to effectively report and discuss test results and issues.  \\n  - Technical skills to understand and work with the test object and related tools.\\n  \\n  **1.5.2. Whole Team Approach**\\n  \\n  A whole team approach to testing involves integrating testing activities throughout the development process, with all team members contributing to and supporting testing efforts. This approach helps to improve quality and efficiency by ensuring that testing is not treated as a separate phase but as an integral part of the development lifecycle.\\n  \\n  **1.5.3. Independence of Testing**\", \"**Typical content of a test plan includes:**\\n\\n- Context of testing (e.g., scope, test objectives, constraints, test basis)\\n- Assumptions and constraints of the test project\\n- Stakeholders (e.g., roles, responsibilities, relevance to testing, hiring, and training needs)\\n- Communication (e.g., forms and frequency of communication, documentation templates)\\n- Risk register (e.g., product risks, project risks)\\n- Test approach (e.g., test levels, test types, test techniques, test deliverables, entry criteria and exit criteria, independence of testing, metrics to be collected, test data requirements, test environment requirements, deviations from the organizational test policy and test strategy)\\n- Budget and schedule\\n\\nMore details about the test plan and its content can be found in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 standard.\\n\\n#### 5.1.2 Tester\\u2019s Contribution to Iteration and Release Planning\\n\\nIn iterative SDLCs, typically two kinds of planning occur: release planning and iteration planning.\", \"- Level of detail of test documentation  \\n  - Choice of test techniques and test approach  \\n  - Extent of test automation  \\n  - Role and responsibilities of a tester  \\n  \\n  In sequential development models, in the initial phases testers typically participate in requirement reviews, test analysis, and test design. The executable code is usually created in the later phases, so typically dynamic testing cannot be performed early in the SDLC.  \\n  \\n  In some iterative and incremental development models, it is assumed that each iteration delivers a working prototype or product increment. This implies that in each iteration both static and dynamic testing may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive regression testing.  \\n  \\n  Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project. Therefore, lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make regression testing easier are favored in agile projects.

Testing and Debugging**\\n  \\n  Testing and debugging are separate activities. Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects in the software (dynamic testing) or can directly find defects in the test object (static testing). When dynamic testing (see chapter 4) triggers a failure, debugging is concerned with finding causes of this failure (defects), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them. The typical debugging process in this case involves:  \\n  - Reproduction of a failure  \\n  - Diagnosis (finding the root cause)  \\n  - Fixing the cause  \\n  \\n  Subsequent confirmation testing checks whether the fixes resolved the problem. Preferably, confirmation testing is done by the same person who performed the initial test. Subsequent regression testing can also be performed, to check whether the fixes are causing failures in other parts of the test object (see section 2.2.3 for more information on confirmation testing and regression testing). When static testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since static testing directly finds defects, and cannot cause failures (see chapter 3).\\n  \\n  **1.2. Why is Testing Necessary?**\", \"- Adzic, G.

The executable code is usually created in the later phases, so typically dynamic testing cannot be performed early in the SDLC.  \\n  \\n  In some iterative and incremental development models, it is assumed that each iteration delivers a working prototype or product increment. This implies that in each iteration both static and dynamic testing may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive regression testing.  \\n  \\n  Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project. Therefore, lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make regression testing easier are favored in agile projects. Also, most of the manual testing tends to be done using experience-based test techniques (see Section 4.4) that do not require extensive prior test analysis and design.  \\n  \\n  **2.1.2. Software Development Lifecycle and Good Testing Practices**  \\n  Good testing practices, independent of the chosen SDLC model, include the following:\", \"- Test analysis: Identifying and analyzing test conditions, requirements, and risks.  \\n  - Test design: Creating test cases, test scripts, and test data.  \\n  - Test implementation: Setting up test environments and executing test cases.  \\n  - Test execution: Running the tests and recording results.  \\n  - Test reporting: Documenting test results, defects, and issues.  \\n  - Test closure: Finalizing testing activities and evaluating test outcomes.\\n  \\n  **1.4.2. Testware**\\n  \\n  Testware is the collection of test-related artifacts and tools used to support testing. This includes:  \\n  - Test plans  \\n  - Test cases  \\n  - Test scripts  \\n  - Test data  \\n  - Test environments  \\n  - Test results  \\n  \\n  **1.4.3. Traceability**\\n  \\n  Maintaining traceability means ensuring that every test case can be traced back to specific requirements or risks. This helps ensure that all requirements are tested and that the test coverage is adequate. Traceability also helps in assessing the impact of changes and managing testing activities effectively.\\n  \\n  **1.4.4. Impact of Context**\\n  \\n  The context in which testing occurs can affect the test process and outcomes. Factors such as the development methodology, project size, team composition, and stakeholder needs all influence how testing is conducted. Understanding the context helps in tailoring the test approach to meet specific project goals and constraints.\\n  \\n  **1.4.5.

DevOps and Testing**  \\n  DevOps is an organizational approach aiming to create synergy by getting development (including testing) and operations to work together to achieve a set of common goals. DevOps requires a cultural shift within an organization to bridge the gaps between development (including testing) and operations while treating their functions with equal value. DevOps promotes team autonomy, fast feedback, integrated toolchains, and technical practices like continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). This enables the teams to build, test and release high-quality code faster through a DevOps delivery pipeline (Kim 2016).  \\n  \\n  From the testing perspective, some of the benefits of DevOps are:  \\n  - Fast feedback on the code quality, and whether changes adversely affect existing code  \\n  - CI promotes a shift-left approach in testing (see section 2.1.5) by encouraging developers to submit high quality code accompanied by component tests and static analysis  \\n  - Promotes automated processes like CI/CD that facilitate establishing stable test environments  \\n  - Increases the view on non-functional quality characteristics (e.g., performance, reliability)  \\n  - Automation through a delivery pipeline reduces the need for repetitive manual testing\", \"testing does not. Static testing includes reviews (see chapter 3) and static analysis. Dynamic testing uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases (see chapter 4). Testing is not only a technical activity. It also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated, monitored and controlled (see chapter 5). Testers use tools (see chapter 6), but it is important to remember that testing is largely an intellectual activity, requiring the testers to have specialized knowledge, use analytical skills and apply critical thinking and systems thinking (Myers 2011, Roman 2018).
